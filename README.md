# Windows 10 scripts

This contains my scripts to setup Windows 10.

Everything in the Debloat Windows 10 comes from the [Debloat Windows 10](https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10) repository. I modified some of those scripts.

Please read the scripts before running the run-all script.
**I am not responsible for broken systems.** You will likely want to modify the
Debloat-Windows-10\utils\install-basic-software.ps1 script.
